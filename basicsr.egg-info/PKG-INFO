# DCPM: Demosaicking customized diffusion model for snapshot polarization imaging

:star: If you've found DCPM useful for your research or projects, please show your support by starring this repo. Thanks! :hugs:

---
>For snapshot polarization imaging, the color polarization demosaicking is essential to reconstruct full resolution
from a mosaic array, which is the latest unsolved issue. Due to the mosaic array missing a large number of
key pixels, existing one-step deep learning-based methods exhibit limited demosaicking performance. Hence,
we make the first attempt to address the color polarization demosaicking task through the diffusion model,
namely DCPM. Specifically, we extend the residual-based diffusion process to the task of color polarization
demosaicking and improve the network architecture to accommodate full-resolution polarization images.
Moreover, considering the polarization property of images, a customized loss function is proposed to assist in
the diffusion model training. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed method.

## Update
- **2025.04.23**: DCPM_v2 is released. Compared to the version in the paper, we use [polanalyser](https://github.com/elerac/polanalyser) to generate the initial interpolation results and train our network using four datasets ([EARI](http://www.ok.sc.e.titech.ac.jp/res/PolarDem/index.html), [Qiu's](https://repository.kaust.edu.sa/items/3653d5cd-a78b-40d7-899e-57f5f137ca85), [PIDSR](https://github.com/PRIS-CV/PIDSR) and Ours)

## TODO
- The dataset we propose will be released at an appropriate time.

## Requirements
```
conda create -n dcpm python=3.10
conda activate dcpm
pip install torch==2.4.0 torchvision==0.19.0 torchaudio==2.4.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
cd DCPM
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py develop
```
## Inference
Download the weight from this link and put it in the folder of "checkpoints".
```
python ./inference/inference_DCPM.py -opt "./options/test/CPDM/test_for_CPDM.yml"
```
The test is performed on simulated data by default. If you want to test on real mosaic images, set "real_cpdm" to "true" in the configuration file, comment out lines 17-25. and uncomment line 16.


## Training
Download the dataset from this link and replace the "datasets" in the project with them.

Begin training:
```
python ./basicsr/train_CPDM.py -opt "./options/train/CPDM/train_for_CPDM.yml"
```
The training results are stored in the "experiments" folder.
